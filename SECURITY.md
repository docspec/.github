# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any DocSpec project, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please send details to the project maintainers privately. Include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 7 days, including next steps and expected timeline for a fix.

## Security Best Practices

When using DocSpec in production:

- Keep dependencies updated
- Validate and sanitize document inputs before processing
- Run conversion services in isolated environments
- Monitor for unusual resource consumption during document processing
